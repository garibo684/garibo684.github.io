## First Day 

On my first day of internship (Monday) I  learned that because of logistic problems, it was best for me to work from home. I left the office two hours early to prepare my computer for tomorrow's work. When I got home, I dual-booted my laptop with Ubuntu 22.04.2. Downloaded necessary programs like Microsoft Teams for 
communication and Visual Studio Code for coding. With the first day of my internship was over.
