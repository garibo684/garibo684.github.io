## First Day 

On my first day of internship (Monday) I  learned that because of logistic
problems, it was best for me to work from home. I left the office two hours
early to prepare my computer for tomorrow's work. When I got home, I dual-booted
my laptop with Ubuntu 22.04.2. Downloaded necessary programs like Microsoft
Teams for communication and Visual Studio Code for coding. 

With this the firstday of my internship was over.


## Creating A Website with GitHub Pages

I started by reading official [guides for Github Pages][guide-gh-pg] and [use of
Jekyll in it][jekyll-pg].				  			  		   
Afterward, I selected a Jekyll theme from the [Jekyll Themes site][jekyll-site].
The theme I selected was [Contrast][contrast-gh]. I selected this theme because
I wanted a simplistic theme that I could work on over time and regularly
improve. To understand each file's effect on the site I have copied 
each file individually. This took almost an hour.
		
Afterward, for three days I worked on it for a limited time every day. During
those days I couldn't even manage to change the site's background color. As a
result of this today I have deleted the site repository and created a new one
using [this guide][guide-site] as a base. 


## Learning The Basics

Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday. On these three days, I started by learning the basic
knowledge that I needed for the project. 

By using community guides and mainlyChatGPT I learned the necessary
theoretical knowledge to start as well as basicLinux command line
through [this tutorial][guide-linux]. 


## Google C++ Style Coding and GTest

Throughout the week I read the official [guide for Google C++ Coding
Style][guide.gc++]. During this read, on numerous occasions, I noticed that I
lost my former expertise in C++ language as well as my previous knowledge. After
realizing this problem I revised some of my former C++ course notes. 

Today after completing the Google C++ Style guide I started and completed
reading the [GoogleTest Primer guide][guide-gtest] for a beginner-level
understanding of GTest. From this guide, I learned assertions and simple test
formats.


## CMake and Conan

During this week I also looked at some guide videos on Youtube for both Conan
and CMake but gave priority to the topics that I talked about before. From these
guides, I learned how to use CMake and Conan on a basic level but I have not
completed these guides yet.


## Plans for the Next Week

Completing the guides that I did not complete yet, is a given. Afterward, I am
planning to code simple C++ projects in Google C++ style to both solidify my
newly learned knowledge and rebuild my forgotten knowledge of C++.
