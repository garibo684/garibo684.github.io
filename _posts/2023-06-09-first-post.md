## First Day (h2)

At my first day of internship (Monday) I learned because of logistic problems it was best for me  to work from home and left work a few hours early to pre-
pare my computer for tomorrows work. When I get home I dual booted my computer with Ubuntu 22.04.2 . Downloaded necessary programs like Microsoft teams for 
communication and Visual Studio Code for coding. With this my first day ofinternship was over.
