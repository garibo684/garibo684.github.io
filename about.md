## About me

I am 20 years old and an Electric Electronic Engineering student at TOBB ETU. I am in the second year of my university life. 
On 05.06.2023 I started my internship at Ulak Haberleşme A.Ş. and I will be an intern there until 14.09.2023. 
I enjoy reading sci-fi and dystopia books. I like learning about ancient and medieval history. I love playing video games. 
I am interested in the process of making video games and in my spare time, I am trying to learn how to make one myself.
For more information, you can read my posts on this blog which I believe over time became a hub for my newly learned knowledge about everything.
